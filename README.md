# Dice


I developed a dice simulation application where a random number is generated upon clicking the 'Roll' button, simulating the roll of a dice. A 'Reset' button is also available to revert the display to its initial state. This is my second project in my JavaScript learning journey.

Technologies used:

HTML


CSS


JavaScript
